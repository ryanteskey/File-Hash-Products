==================

CIS 282
Files Assignment

To turn in:
	Attach a file files_lastname.rb as an attachment to the assignment in Canvas.
	Subject line: CIS 282, Name, Files

To do:
Take your program from the Hash Assignment and modify it to use files for storing the data instead of initializing the data at run-time.

Write a program that will read a datafile to initialize its Hash on startup.
When the user selects Exit, your program should then write the Hash into the same data file so that it can be read the next time it is run.  Any new items that are created by the user need to be written to the file at the same time.

The format of the file should be:
123,shirt,9.99
234,pants,19.50
456,socks,3.99

The rest of the Hash program should work as before, so if it did not work the first time, now is your chance to get it working again.
